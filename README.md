## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to use media breakpoints to change the layout based on the viewport. I also learned how to use and resize background images, as well as use the details tag in html.

### Continued development

Continued development and improvement for this solution includes making it responsive for all sizes of viewports, not only the specified ones.
